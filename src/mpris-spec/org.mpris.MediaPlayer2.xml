          Brings the media player's user interface to the front using any
          appropriate mechanism available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The media player may be unable to control how its user interface
          is displayed, or it may not have a graphical user interface at all.
          In this case, the <tp:member-ref>CanRaise</tp:member-ref> property is
          <strong>false</strong> and this method does nothing.
        </p>

        <p>Causes the media player to stop running.</p>
        <p>
          The media player may refuse to allow clients to shut it down.
          In this case, the <tp:member-ref>CanQuit</tp:member-ref> property is
          <strong>false</strong> and this method does nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Media players which can be D-Bus activated, or for which there is
          no sensibly easy way to terminate a running instance (via the main
          interface or a notification area icon for example) should allow clients
          to use this method. Otherwise, it should not be needed.
        </p>
        <p>If the media player does not have a UI, this should be implemented.</p>

          If <strong>false</strong>, calling

          raise a NotSupported error.  If <strong>true</strong>, calling
          <tp:member-ref>Quit</tp:member-ref> will cause the media application
          to attempt to quit (although it may still be prevented from quitting
          by the user, for example).

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Whether the media player is occupying the fullscreen.</p>
        <p>
          This is typically used for videos.  A value of <strong>true</strong>
          indicates that the media player is taking up the full screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media centre software may well have this value fixed to <strong>true</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If <tp:member-ref>CanSetFullscreen</tp:member-ref> is <strong>true</strong>,
          clients may set this property to <strong>true</strong> to tell the media player
          to enter fullscreen mode, or to <strong>false</strong> to return to windowed
          mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <tp:member-ref>CanSetFullscreen</tp:member-ref> is <strong>false</strong>,
          then attempting to set this property should have no effect, and may raise
          an error.  However, even if it is <strong>true</strong>, the media player
          may still be unable to fulfil the request, in which case attempting to set
          this property will have no effect (but should not raise an error).
        </p>
        <tp:rationale>
          <p>
            This allows remote control interfaces, such as LIRC or mobile devices like
            phones, to control whether a video is shown in fullscreen.

        <p>
          If <strong>false</strong>, attempting to set
          <tp:member-ref>Fullscreen</tp:member-ref> will have no effect, and may
          raise an error.  If <strong>true</strong>, attempting to set
          <tp:member-ref>Fullscreen</tp:member-ref> will not raise an error, and (if it
          is different from the current value) will cause the media player to attempt to
          enter or exit fullscreen mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the media player may be unable to fulfil the request.
          In this case, the value will not change.  If the media player knows in
          advance that it will not be able to fulfil the request, however, this
          property should be <strong>false</strong>.
        </p>
        <tp:rationale>
          <p>
            This allows clients to choose whether to display controls for entering
            or exiting fullscreen mode.

          This can be viewed as protocols supported by the player in almost
          all cases.  Almost every media player will include support for the
          "file" scheme.  Other common schemes are "http" and "rtsp".
