.SH NAME
gmediarender \- UPNP-AV renderer daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gmediarender
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B gmediarender
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBgmediarender\fP is a daemon which acts as a UPNP-AV renderer on the 
local network.  It can be controlled from a UPNP-AV control point to 
play media files from a UPNP-AV media server through an audio device
on the local system.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.SS "Application options:"
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-daemon
Runs the program as a daemon.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-friendly\-name \fI\<name\>\fP
Friendly name to advertise on the network.

Usually, it is desirable for the renderer 
to show up on controllers under a recognisable and unique name. This is 
the option to set that name.
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-ip\-address \fI\<ip-address\>\fP
The local IP address the service is running and advertised on.  

This can 
only be a single address, and must be explicitly specified (i.e. not 
0.0.0.0).
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-port \fI\<port>\fP
Port to listen to. [49152..65535].

\fBlibupnp\fP does not use SO_REUSEADDR, 
so it might be necessary to increment this number.
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-pid\-file \fI\<pidfile\>\fP                    
Name of the file which the process ID should be written to.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-uuid \fI\<uuid>\fP
UUID to advertise on the network in the form \fIuser:group\fP.

This sets the UPNP UUID that is advertised and used by controllers to 
distinguish different renderers.
Usually, \fBgmediarender\fP uses a built-in static id. 
If there are multiple renderers running on the local network, they will all 
share the same static ID.
With this option, each renderer can be given its own id.
One way to generate a UUID is to create a UUID once by running the 
\fBuuidgen\fP tool.
.TP
.B \-\-mime-filter \fI\<filter>\fP
Filters the advertised MIME types supported by the renderer. 

Normally, \fBgmediarender\fP advertises all MIME types (media formats) supported by the 
output. Use this option to limit the advertised media support or add/remove
support for a specific type.

Filters take 3 forms. Multiple filters are separated by a comma.
 
\(bu Prefix filters will only advertise MIME types that match the supplied prefix. e.g. audio, video, image.

\(bu Inclusion filters will add the supplied type to the supported list. e.g. +audio/x-flac

\(bu Removal filters will remove the supplied type from the supported list. e.g. -audio/x-flac

e.g. To allow only audio, without FLAC but include FLV. --mime-filter audio,-audio/x-flac,+video/x-flv
.SS "Audio options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-gstout\-audiosink\fP \fI\<sink\>\fP
Set the audio sink.
.TP
\fB\-\-gstout\-audiodevice\fP \fI\<device\>\fP
Set the audio device.

The \fB\-\-gstout\-audio\.\.\.\fP options allow the user to configure 
where the sound output from 
\fBgmediarender\fP is sent.  The correct values will depend on which 
method of audio output (e.g. ALSA) is being used.  
.TP
.B \-\-gstout\-initial\-volume\-db \fI\<volume\>\fP
Sets the initial volume on startup in decibels.

Values range from 0 (maximum volume) to \-60 (minimum volume. The decibel 
scale is non\-linear: \-20db represents roughly half volume.  The 
default value is 0.

Note that this does not
influence the hardware (e.g. ALSA) volume level, but only internal attenuation.
It is advisable to set the hardware level to 100\% where possible.
.TP
.B \-\-list\-outputs
List available output modules and exit.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output \fI\<module\>\fR
Output module to use.

Use \fB\-\-output\fP to obtain a list of valid modules.
.SS "Debug options:"

.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-devicedesc\fR
Dump device descriptor XML and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-connmgr\-scpd\fR
Dump Connection Manager service description XML and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-control\-scpd\fR
Dump Rendering Control service description XML and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-transport\-scpd\fR
Dump A/V Transport service description XML and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-logfile \fI\<logfile\>\fP              
Name of a file to log output of the program to.  

To log to the terminal use
use \-\-logfile \/dev\/stdout
This file can get quite large over time, so it is only recommended to use
this option for debugging purposes.
.SS "Help options"
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-all\fR
Show all help options.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-gstout\fR
Show GStreamer Output Options.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-gst\fR
Show GStreamer Options.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show the program version.
