Headless UPnP Renderer
----------------------

I needed a small headless UPnP media renderer for Linux (for small footprint-use
in a Raspberry Pi or CuBox), but there was not much available.

Found this old project [GMediaRender][orig-project] - but it
was incomplete, several basic features missing and the project has been
abandoned several years ago.

So this is a fork of those sources to resurrect this renderer and add the
missing features to be useful (Original sources in [savannah cvs][orig-cvs]).
To distinguish this project from the original one, this is called
**[gmrender-resurrect](http://github.com/hzeller/gmrender-resurrect)**.

After many features added, this is now a very usable, headless UPnP
renderer that I would consider **stable**. You don't see many changes in this git - don't worry,
this project is not abandoned, but it just works as intended (I use it every day).
If you run into problems, please file bugs, write me directly or send a pull request; I am busy
but will try to respond.

If you have tested gmrender resurrect with your control point, **please add
it to the [Compatibility Wiki][compat-wiki] page** (even if there is a problem).
At this point, it should work with all media controllers, if not,
please file a bug so that we can figure out the issue and I can make it work
for you. See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) how to create a logfile that helps
to narrow down things.

If you're running this on a Raspberry Pi, you might be interested to connect
a little LCD display. Check out the **[upnp-display][]** github project.
