GMediaRender
============

Introduction
------------

GMediaRender is a UPnP(tm) media renderer for POSIX(r)-compliant
systems, such as Linux(r) or UNIX(r). It implements the server 
component that provides UPnP controllers a means to render media 
content (audio, video and images) from a UPnP media server.

Requirements
------------

The following programs are required to build GMediaRender:

    * GNU C Compiler (gcc), 2.95 or later.

The following libraries are required to build and run GMediaRender:

    * Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp), 1.6.0 or later (BSD license)
        http://pupnp.sourceforge.net/
	
    * GStreamer 0.10 (LGPL)
	http://www.gstreamer.net/


Note that GMediaRender completely relies on GStreamer for rendering
content, so if your GStreamer environment does not support a given
media format, GMediaRender won't either.

You can test this from the command line:

   gst-launch-0.10 playbin uri=file:///path/to/file
